Installing a package
!pip install mrjob


To Run a file with data file named u.date inside dataDir folder in which even the program lies:
!python RatingCounter.py dataDir/u.data


TO bring the data into another file:
!python FriendsByAge.py fakefriends.csv > friendsavgresult.txt


Mapper function signatures
 1) def mapper(self,key,line):
 2) def mapper(self, _, line):
 
 
Chaining:
 Take key values from reducer and then feed that as input to another mapper
 Note : map reduce will sort values automatically for us, So all we need to do is 


When you do chaing map reduces with map1 red1 map2 red 2 in cluster environment Output might nnot be sorted expecially in sorting problems
To solve that
   1. Use only 1 reducer like map1 to map2 to red 
   or
   2.Sort again after the reducer 2's result
   

Ancillary Files:
Sometimes the end result of one data set is not quite the result for ex: topmoviecode:1234 We need to further look in some other ancillary 
data set to understand what does 1234 means?

Declaring a dictionary and loading with key value pairs:
self.movienames = {}
        with open("movies.csv") as f:
            for line in f:
                fields = line.split('|')
                self.movienames[fields[0]]=fields[1].decode('utf-8','ignore')
                
Decoding utf8
 func.decode('utf-8','ignore')
 
configure options is a class function
 It helps to onfly pass a file or text to program which needs this auxillary file or text apart from input text

        def configure_options(self):
               super(MostPopularSuperHero, self).configure_options()
               self.add_file_option('--names', help='Path to Marvel-names.txt')

        def configure_options(self):
               super(MRBFSIteration,self).configure_options()
               self.add_passthrough_option('__target',help = ' ID of charecter we need to search for')
